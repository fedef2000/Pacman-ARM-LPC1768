# Pacman-ARM-LPC1768
This project was developed for the Computer Architecture course in the Master’s degree program in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.

The project implements a Pac-Man game for the LandTiger LPC1768 Board using Keil µVision. The game features a fully interactive labyrinth where Pac-Man, controlled via a joystick, collects standard and power pills while avoiding a single ghost that alternates between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing when a power pill is consumed, using a greedy pathfinding algorithm. Additional features include a teleport mechanic, sound effects played through the board’s speaker, and CAN bus communication for transmitting game data.
